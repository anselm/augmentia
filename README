bugs major,
 
 - why can i not drop stuff?
 
 - globe view on and or map
 
 - show friends - fetch twitter friend networks by proxy onto my server and then relay them here

 - screen cast

bigs minor,

 - poke critters into the world - and set limits - and user login
 
 - support pan and tilt
 
 - camera overlay
 
 - flurry

 - geolocation is weird

demo
