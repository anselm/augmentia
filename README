This is an augmented reality app for the iphone - first steps.

It talks to the locative server at http://locative.makerlab.org.

The hope is to use it as a foundation for a variety of projects such as say letting me see my twitter friends, or various forms of art and environmental perception, or to play with game like ideas...
